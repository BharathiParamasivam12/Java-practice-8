Would you like me to add specific coding questions or system design scenarios for any of these days?


Awesome! Here are **specific coding questions and system design scenarios** for each relevant day. This will help you test yourself more thoroughly:

---

### âœ… **Day-by-Day Add-on: Coding & Design Challenges**

#### **ðŸŸ¢ Day 1 â€“ MongoDB**
**Coding Tasks:**
- Write an aggregation to:
  - Count the number of users per country
  - List top 3 products per category by sales
- Query optimization:
  - Index suggestions for query filtering on multiple fields

---

#### **ðŸŸ¢ Day 2 â€“ Microservices Basics**
**Design Scenario:**
- **Design a URL Shortener (like Bitly)**
  - Focus on separation of services, API Gateway, DB per service
  - Discuss read/write optimization, scalability

**Coding:**
- RESTful controller for UserService (register/login APIs)

---

#### **ðŸŸ¢ Day 3 â€“ Microservices Advanced**
**Design Scenario:**
- **Design a Ride-Sharing System (Uber-style)**
  - Include location service, trip service, notification service
  - Use Kafka for real-time updates

**Coding:**
- Implement a basic circuit breaker using Resilience4j in a Spring Boot app

---

#### **ðŸŸ¢ Day 4 â€“ Kafka & RabbitMQ**
**Kafka Tasks:**
- Write a Spring Boot Kafka producer & consumer
- Implement offset handling manually
- Simulate at-least-once delivery and idempotency

**RabbitMQ:**
